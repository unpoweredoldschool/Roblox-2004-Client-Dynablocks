# Roblox-2004-Client-Dynablocks
its the original Dynablocks client from 2004.
UHJK to move camera.
Go button is too old so it might not work but other buttons work.
Double press the application called "dynablocks".
Choose a map,
if you dont choose a map, it will be only a sky.
The application called "G3DTest" is the same as the dynablocks application.
Choose the map that tarty created and you will see what dynablocks players looked like, you can do this if you want.
this is not a joke, its the real 2004 roblox.
